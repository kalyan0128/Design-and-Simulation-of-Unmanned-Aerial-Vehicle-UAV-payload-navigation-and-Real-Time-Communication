## Project Overview

Inspired by Falcon 9's pioneering work in reusable rocket technology, this project explores the development of a scaled-down unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that mimics fundamental principles such as vertical take-off, autonomous 3D navigation, and precision landing. Designed for terrestrial, controlled conditions, this UAV operates autonomously using real-time sensor feedback and robust communication links without human intervention.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous VTOL**: Vertical Take-Off and Landing without pilot control.
- **3D Navigation**: Navigate to specific coordinates using PID-based control.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Two-way data exchange with a ground station via LoRa.
- **Electric Propulsion**: Environmentally friendly, reusable electric motors.
- **Ground Control Station**: Telemetry and command updates in real-time.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming**: C++
- **Microcontrollers**: RPI-PICO
- **Sensors**: IMU, GPS, Ultrasonic, Temperature, Barometric
- **Communication**: LoRa Modules
- **Control Algorithms**: PID Control
- **Power System**: Lithium Polymer Battery (14V, 4500mAh)
